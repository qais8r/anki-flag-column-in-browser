## Description
⚑ Adds a **flag column** to the Anki Browse window. Because flags are displayed in their own column, cards are no longer color-highlighted by flag, allowing suspended or buried cards to remain visually distinguishable.

This makes it easy to see a card's suspension or buried status without relying on other columns when flagged. A very common use case would be flagging all high yield cards, but still wanting to see suspended and buried cards in the Browse window at a glance.

## Usage
- Open the Browse window and enable the flags column (if hidden) to see suspension and burial status alongside your cards.
- You can change the flag outline color via Tools → “Flag Column Settings...” (auto/black/white/match flag color).
- **Note:** You may see your columns are spaced differently upon installation. Simply resize your columns and they should persist.

## Changelog
- **Version 1.0** - Initial release.
- **Version 1.1** - Added configurable flag outline color (including auto, black, white, and match flag color).
